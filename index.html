        Counseling is a sacred trust because God, among many things, is Jehovah Rapha - the God who heals.
        Each time He brings a hurting person into our care, it is an opportunity to be His ambassador.

      <h2>What is Christian Counseling?</h2>

      <p>
        We believe Christian counseling marries current evidence-based psychological techniques and practices with
        Christian principles and values. It promotes no organized religion or religious denomination but works from
        a Biblical worldview.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our clients will have the assurance that what the counselor suggests will not conflict with what the Bible
        teaches. As Christian counselors we know that complete healing can only take place when all aspects of a
        personâ€™s life are addressed.
