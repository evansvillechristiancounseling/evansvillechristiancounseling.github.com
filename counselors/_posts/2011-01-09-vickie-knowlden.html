  <h2>Counselor - Vickie Knowlden</h2>

  <p>
    Vickie Knowlden began her formal education at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls,
    Texas. She and her husband then moved to Evansville, Indiana where she completed her
    Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Social Work at the University of Southern Indiana.
    She is licensed with the State of Indiana as a Licensed Clinical Social Worker. Vickie is
    also a Board Certified Professional Christian Counselor with the American Association of
    Christian Counselors.
  </p>
  <p>
    Vickie's desire from the beginning of her education was to be able to combine her love of
    Jesus Christ and her training as a clinical social worker in order to serve the needs of
    her clients more effectively.

    She has over fourteen years of counseling experience in her private practice. She volunteers
    her time to counsel young women with drug and alcohol addictions in her community at a Teen

    organizations where she recently had the opportunity to counsel with victims of the earthquake
    in Haiti.

    every counseling session in order to provide genuine healing and wholeness to individuals,
