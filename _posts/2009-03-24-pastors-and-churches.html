  <h2>Pastors & Churches</h2>

  <p>
    Pastors often, do not have time to personally counsel the members of their congregation
    or they do not feel comfortable counseling certain issues. This is where Christian
    Counseling Services can be of benefit to you.
  </p>

  <p>
    The staff at Christian Counseling Services is professionally trained and has malpractice insurance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pastors and their churches can benefit in many ways by partnering with us. For instance:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Help with counseling workload</li>
    <li>Protect yourself from false accusations</li>
    <li>
      Provide the members of your congregation with professionally trained counselors without adding staff
    </li>
  </ul>
