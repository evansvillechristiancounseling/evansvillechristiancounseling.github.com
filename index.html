        Counseling is a sacred trust because God is the one who heals. Each time He brings a hurting person or
        family into our care, we believe it is an opportunity to be His ambassadors.

      <h2>What is Christian Counseling?</h2>

      <p>
        Christian Counseling combines current evidence-based psychological techniques and practices with
        Christian principles and values. It promotes no organized religion or religious denomination but
        works from a Biblical worldview.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clients have the assurance that what the counselor suggests will not conflict with what the Bible
        teaches. Christian Counselors know that complete healing can only take place when all aspects of
        a person's life are addressed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both Christian counseling and secular counseling share the same desire to help people overcome
        their problems, find meaning and joy in life, and become healthy and well-adjusted individuals,
        both mentally and emotionally. Both usually have graduate degrees and have spent years learning
        their craft, but Christian counselors believe that the Bible, not psychology, is the final authority.
      </p>

      <p class="passage">
       <em>"His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through our knowledge
        of Him who called us by His own glory and goodness"</em> (2 Peter 1:3).
      </p>

      <p>
        A Christian Counselor's major responsibility is to help their client substitute errors and lies they
        have believed about themselves and their world with Biblical truth. When people are set free, they
        are fulfilling their true calling.
      </p>

      <p class="passage">
        <em>"Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free"</em> (John 8:32).
