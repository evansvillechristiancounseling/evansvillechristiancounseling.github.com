    <h2>Counselor - Ellen Robinson</h2>

    <p>
      My name is Ellen Robinson. I obtained my Master’s in Marriage and Family Therapy from Liberty University
      and I hold an associate license of Marriage and Family Therapy for the state of Indiana. I chose the
      field of counseling and mental health because in life, sometimes we face hardships that aren’t easy
      to walk through alone and I want to come alongside you to encourage and help you through them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am a Christian and a Christ-follower therefore my counseling has a Christian perspective. I chose to be
      specific in Marriage and Family because that is what I am most passionate about and I felt God’s calling
      to. I lean toward the approach of solution-focused for my clients, because I see the most change when we
      focus on the future in a positive way and not the problem itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      My passion and expertise is in helping newlyweds and young married couples, as well as women struggling
      with anxiety and depression. During our first few sessions together we will go over what to expect in
      therapy and look at what your goals would be and steps to reach them. I look forward to hearing from you!
    </p>
