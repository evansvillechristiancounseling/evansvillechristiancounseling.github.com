  <h2>Statement of Faith</h2>

  <ul>
    <li> We believe the Bible is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative written Word of God</li>
    <li> We believe there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy
      Spirit</li>
    <li> We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, His Virgin birth, His sinless life, His miraculous ministry,
      His atoning death, in His bodily resurrection, in His Ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His
      personal return to power and glory.</li>
    <li> We believe the only means of being cleansed from sin is through repentance and faith in the precious blood of
      Jesus Christ.</li>
    <li> We believe in the spiritual unity of believers in Christ and strive to work cooperatively with all who claim
      His name in faith.</li>
    <li> We believe that the truth will set us free. We stand against Satanâ€™s lies by taking every thought captive in
      obedience to Christ. We choose to speak the truth in love.</li>
    <li> We trust our Heavenly Father to direct our lives and give us power to live by the Holy Spirit, so that He can
      guide us into all truth. </li>
    <li> We renounce all selfish goals and choose the greatest goal of love. We choose to obey the two greatest
      commandments: to love the Lord with all our heart, soul, and mind and to love our neighbor as much as we love
      ourselves. </li>
  </ul>
